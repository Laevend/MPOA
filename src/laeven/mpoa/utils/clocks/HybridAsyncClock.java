/**
 * 
 * @author Laeven
 * An Async Clock designed for semi-frequent saving operations.
 * <p>
 * To prevent massive IO use but also keep things as up to date as possible,
 * when an action is performed that requires writing, it is scheduled to happen
 * after a set amount of time. If no further actions requiring saving are performed
 * during this time, then the save is initiated. If an action is performed, the clock
 * will reset and wait again.
 * <p>
 * A hard limit of 5 minutes is used to force save to prevent the clock never saving
 * from infrequent action use
 * <p>
 * TLDR: Most up-to-date data is always saved with the least IO ops.
